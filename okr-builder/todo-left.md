### Backend (Phase 3)
- [x] **Reconcile Agent Implementation:** Integrate the `@copilotkit/runtime` implementation from `copilot-integration.ts` into `index.ts` to properly expose the `/api/copilotkit` endpoint.
- [x] **Implement LangGraph Agent (Optional):** Decide if the current `okr-agent.ts` implementation is sufficient, or refactor to use `StatefulGraph` from `@langchain/langgraph` for more robust, stateful logic.

### Frontend (Phase 4)
- [x] **Finalize Styling Strategy:** Decide whether to integrate Tailwind CSS or continue exclusively with Material UI. If using only Material UI, this can be checked off.
- [x] **Implement Chat Suggestions:** Use the `useCopilotChatSuggestions` hook to provide relevant prompts for OKR planning.

### Integration (Phase 5)
- [x] **Create Root `package.json`:** Create a `package.json` in the root of the `okr-builder` directory.
- [x] **Install `concurrently`:** Add `concurrently` as a dev dependency in the root `package.json`.
- [x] **Add `dev` Script:** Add a script to the root `package.json` to start both the `frontend` and `backend` services with a single command.

### Testing (Phase 5)
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing:** After the backend implementation is unified, conduct thorough testing of the bidirectional data flow.
- [ ] **Test UI to Backend:** Make changes in the UI and verify that the backend agent's state is updated correctly.
- [ ] **Test Backend to UI:** Use the chat to ask the AI to make a change and verify that the UI reflects this change in real-time.
